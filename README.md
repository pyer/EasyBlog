# Easy
Ruby static web site generator

## Usage

- rake build : builds HTML pages in `site` directory.
- rake clean : deletes `site` directory and temporary files.
- rake run   : runs Webrick server. Then the web site can be tested on [http://localhost:8080]

## Content

### Pages

Pages are the most basic building block for content.

The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML or Markdown file in the `pages` directory. The file name will be the title of the site page.

Markdown files use a .md extension and are converted to HTML on build.

### Posts

Posts are in `posts` directory.
  
To add a new post, simply add a Markdown file in the `posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD_name-of-post.md`.

The file name is converted to the date and the title of the post.

## Layouts

Layouts are templates that wrap around your content. They allow you to have the source code for your site in one place so you donâ€™t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page.

Layouts, theme and CSS are in `templates` directory.
